# ZenStates

This project was originally created to enable simple P-state overclocking on ASUS AM4 motherboards from the OS. It's no longer maintained but may be freely used as a base or for parts for anyone interested in continuing this project.

It was created using Visual Studio 2017 and requires the WinRing driver and library to run (https://1drv.ms/u/s!Atmpv-6qHr_6r-YV1-C0ht0nCQiHKA).
